# Practical Skills Evaluation  

Thank you for taking the time to demonstrate your ability as a developer by participating in this practical skills evaluation.  

## Objective  

* When launching the site there are two images displayed, one of a generic "walking man" image and the other a colorful picture of a "store".
* The "walking man" image needs to be able to be dragged with the mouse around the page.
* When the "walking man" image is dropped on the "store", the following message should be displayed:
> "I just ate 1620 calories!!!"

## Rules  

1. The final message must come from the Shop action in the Home controller.
2. You must return the Caloric total by passing the following array of data to the Shop action:
  * [{ Type: "Steak", Count: 1 }, { Type: "Potato", Count: 2 }, { Type: "Banana", Count: 4 }]
  * The combined amount of calories for the above array should be 1620
3. Feel free to use whatever resources are available to you to complete this project.  However, this is not a team exercise, please work on this project on your own.
4. Though your time will play a factor in the evaluation of your solution, it won't	be strictly held against you.  Take your time and get the work right.
5. Feel free to add any additional frameworks to the project that you feel will	help you complete the exercise.
6. You decide how to best display the final message.  Alerts are fine, additional HTML positioned on the page is fine too.  Your decision.

## Testing  

1. Adding unit tests will give you extra credit.  Not adding them will NOT hurt your evaluation.
2. Be sure to test with different amounts of each item to be sure you have a thorough solution

Thank you again, and good luck!
